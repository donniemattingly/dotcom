title: Scanning Film

When I send a roll of film off to be developed there are two main things that a film lab can do that I currently can not - developing and scaning. If I want to develop film at home (which I do) then I need to have a solution for both of these. Before attempting the more involved process of actually developing film, I decided to make sure I could scan the film after it had been developed.
