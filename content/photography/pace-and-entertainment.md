Disagreement is a fundamental aspect of the human experience. I think sports are so interesting to so many people partially for this reason, as it gives more people a shared context on which to disagree. Sports offer a field on which ideas can regularly do battle, and each week we as fans can survey the results and draw conclusions. As the college basketball season starts to wind up, one of the debates that I've always found interesting was that of pace. What makes a more exciting game, slow paced or fast? 

This discussion usually begins when a team like Virgina or Wisconsin is getting a lot of air time, and commentators need to fill dead air between posession after posession of exhaugsting the shot clock. These two teams have some of the slowest paced offenses in the game, and yet are considered some of the most exciting by their fans. 'Each shot matters more' is what you will hear as justification for the forty-five to twenty-six abomination that just occured (yes, [this happened](http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/boxscore?gameId=400609058)). What exactly constitutes a more exciting game is a bit hard to pin down, but I wanted to take a look at this claim. 

To explore this claim, I'm using data from [kenpom.com](http://www.kenpom.com). He offers a $20 subscription for full access to all of his data, and if you're remotely interested in college basketball analytics it's very worthwhile. Pomeroy has a concept of [leverage](http://kenpom.com/blog/win-probability-for-every-college-game/) that he uses to indicate whether a given posession is more or less important to the overall outcome of a game. He generates a time series evolution of the win probabilities of each team, and you can consider the slope of the graph between each piece in time to be the leverage of a given posession. The graphs below better illustrate this idea, but generally if there are big swings in the chances either team is going to win a game for a given posession, then that posession has a lot of leverage. 

This is an example of what I consider an exciting game, the 2015 national championship game.

This is an example of a not so exciting game, the aforementioned 45-26 snoozer.
