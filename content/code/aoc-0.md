[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a yearly programming challenge that releases a pair of problems every day in December leading up to Christmas. It's a good excuse to do a different type of thinking than you typically encounter doing software development, and at work we have a competition with prizes for those who finish a certain number of problems.

Last year, I decided to the the challenge in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org), and, while I didn't finish (it was a crazy time at work), I really enjoyed the opportunity to try out a language I was interested in but had no real other opportunity to use. I've alway been interested in different programming languages, especially functional programming languages, and Advent of Code is a good excuse to do something more than the online tutorials. 

Wanting to both up the ante and provide an excuse for myself when I fizzled out around day 8, this year I'm attempting to do the problems for each day in a different programming language. I wanted to use a mix of languages I had used and those I hadn't, and I picked languages that were serious programming languages, so no [Trumpscript](https://github.com/samshadwell/TrumpScript). The languages I'm intending on using (in no order) are:

- [Swift](https://swift.org)
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org)
- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
- [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org)
- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org)
- [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org)
- [Elm](https://elm-lang.org)
- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org)
- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Clojure](https://clojure.org)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- [Perl](https://www.perl.org)
- [C / C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
- [Julia](https://julialang.org)
- [OCaml](https://ocaml.org)
- [F#](https://fsharp.org)
- [Common Lisp](https://common-lisp.net) 
- [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org)
- [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org)
- [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog)
- [Go](https://golang.org)
- [J](http://www.jsoftware.com)
- [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language))

I've got a [github repo](https://github.com/donniemattingly/aoc2018) with all the code, a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n4-w7unwe4NbI0Nfyhp4Ca8XlEOArJtDrGl_RJSIZoo/edit?usp=sharing) documenting my progress, and I plan on updating my progress here as things go on as well.
